## Getting Started


### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Tensorflow

#### Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Example
Run the main script to train and test the network on XOR data:
```bash
python main.py
```

You will see training progress and sample predictions formatted in a readable table.
